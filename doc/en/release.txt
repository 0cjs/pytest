pytest release checklist
-------------------------

For doing a release of pytest (status March 2015) holger does:

1. change version numbers in ``setup.py``, ``_pytest/__init__.py``
   to a final release version.

2. finalize ``./CHANGELOG`` (don't forget the the header).

3. write ``doc/en/announce/release-VERSION.txt``
   (usually copying from an earlier release version).

4. change ``version`` and ``release`` in doc/en/conf.py, set ``SITETARGET=latest``
   in ``doc/en/Makefile``.

5. regenerate doc examples with ``tox -e regen`` and check with ``hg diff``
   if the differences show regressions.  It's a bit of a manual process because
   there a large part of the diff is about pytest headers or differences in
   speed ("tests took X.Y seconds"). (XXX automate doc/example diffing to ignore
   such changes and integrate it into "tox -e regen").

6. ``devpi upload`` to `your developer devpi index <http://doc.devpi.net/latest/quickstart-releaseprocess.html>`_. You can create your own user and index on https://devpi.net,
   an inofficial service from the devpi authors.

7. run ``devpi use INDEX`` and ``devpi test`` from linux and windows machines
   and verify test results on the index.  On linux typically all environments
   pass (March 2015 there is a setup problem with a cx_freeze environment)
   but on windows all involving ``pexpect`` fail because pexpect does not exist
   on windows and tox does not allow to have platform-specific environments.
   Also on windows ``py33-trial`` fails but should probably pass (March 2015).
   In any case, py26,py27,py33,py34 are required to pass for all platforms.

8. You can fix tests/code and repeat number 7. until everything passes.

9. Once you have sufficiently passing tox tests you can do the actual release::

     cd doc/en/
     make install
     make install-pdf  # a bit optional, if you have latex packages installed

     devpi push pytest-VERSION pypi:NAME
     hg ci -m "... finalized pytest-VERSION"
     hg tag VERSION
     hg push

10. send out release announcement to pytest-dev@python.org,
    testing-in-python@lists.idyll.org and python-announce-list@python.org .

11. **after the release** bump the version numbers in ``setup.py``,
    ``_pytest/__init__.py``, ``doc/en/conf.py`` to the next Minor release
    version (i.e. if you released ``pytest-2.8.0``, set it to ``pytest-2.9.0.dev1``)
    and set ``SITETARGET=dev`` in ``doc/en/makefile``. Commit.

12. already done :)
