The default logging format has been changed to improve readability. Here is an
example of a previous logging message::

    test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py    3 CRITICAL critical message logged by test

This has now become::

    CRITICAL root:test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py:3 critical message logged by test

The formatting can be changed through the `log_format <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#confval-log_format>`__ configuration option.
