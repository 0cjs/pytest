pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The previous
behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test suites which configure warning
filters to match their needs. Note that as a side-effect of this is that ``DeprecationWarning``
and ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are no longer shown by default.
