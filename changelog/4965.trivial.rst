New ``pytest_report_to_serializable`` and ``pytest_report_from_serializable`` **experimental** hooks.

These hooks will be used by ``pytest-xdist``, ``pytest-subtests``, and the replacement for
resultlog to serialize and customize reports.

They are experimental, meaning that their details might change or even be removed
completely in future patch releases without warning.

Feedback is welcome from plugin authors and users alike.
