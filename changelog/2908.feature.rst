``DeprecationWarning`` and ``PendingDeprecationWarning`` are now shown by default if no other warning filter is
configured. This makes pytest more compliant with
`PEP-0506 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0565/#recommended-filter-settings-for-test-runners>`_. See
`the docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html#deprecationwarning-and-pendingdeprecationwarning>`_ for
more info.
