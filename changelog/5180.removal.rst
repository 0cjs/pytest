As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
removed:

* ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

* ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

* ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.
