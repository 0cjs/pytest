As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now
removed:

* ``Request.getfuncargvalue``: use ``Request.getfixturevalue`` instead.

* ``pytest.raises`` and ``pytest.warns`` no longer support strings as the second argument.

* ``message`` parameter of ``pytest.raises``.

* ``pytest.raises``, ``pytest.warns`` and ``ParameterSet.param`` now use native keyword-only
  syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise
  ``TypeError`` on unknown keyword arguments as before.

* ``pytest.config`` global variable.
