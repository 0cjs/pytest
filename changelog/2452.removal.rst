``Config.warn`` has been deprecated, it should be replaced by calls to the standard ``warnings.warn``.

``Node.warn`` now supports two signatures:

* ``node.warn(PytestWarning("some message"))``: is now the recommended way to call this function. The warning
  instance must be a ``PytestWarning`` or subclass  instance.

* ``node.warn("CI", "some message")``: this code/message form is now deprecated and should be converted to
  the warning instance form above.

``RemovedInPytest4Warning`` and ``PytestExperimentalApiWarning`` are now part of the public API and should be accessed
using ``pytest.RemovedInPytest4Warning`` and ``pytest.PytestExperimentalApiWarning``.
