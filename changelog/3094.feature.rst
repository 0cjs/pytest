`Class xunit-style <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/xunit_setup.html>`__ functions and methods
now obey the scope of *autouse* fixtures.

This fixes a number of surprising issues like ``setup_method`` being called before session-scoped
autouse fixtures (see `#517 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/517>`__ for an example).
