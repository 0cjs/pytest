The following accesses have been documented as deprecated for years, but are now actually emitting deprecation warnings.

* Access of ``Module``, ``Function``, ``Class``, ``Instance``, ``File`` and ``Item`` through ``Node`` instances. Now
  users will this warning::

        usage of Function.Module is deprecated, please use pytest.Module instead

  Users should just ``import pytest`` and access those objects using the ``pytest`` module.

* ``request.cached_setup``, this was the precursor of the setup/teardown mechanism available to fixtures. You can
  consult `funcarg comparision section in the docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/funcarg_compare.html>`_.
