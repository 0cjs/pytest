The following accesses have been documented as deprecated for years, but are now actually emitting deprecation warnings.

* Access of ``Module``, ``Function``, ``Class``, ``Instance``, ``File`` and ``Item`` through ``Node`` instances. Now
  users will this warning::

        usage of Function.Module is deprecated, please use pytest.Module instead

  Users should just ``import pytest`` and access those objects using the ``pytest`` module.

* ``request.cached_setup``, this was the precursor of the setup/teardown mechanism available to fixtures. You can
  consult `funcarg comparision section in the docs <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/funcarg_compare.html>`_.

* Using objects named ``"Class"`` as a way to customize the type of nodes that are collected in ``Collector``
  subclasses has been deprecated. Users instead should use ``pytest_collect_make_item`` to customize node types during
  collection.

  This issue should affect only advanced plugins who create new collection types, so if you see this warning
  message please contact the authors so they can change the code.
