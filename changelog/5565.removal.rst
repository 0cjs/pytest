Removed unused support code for `unittest2 <https://pypi.org/project/unittest2/>`__.

The ``unittest2`` backport module is no longer
necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn't seem
to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.

Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support
for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used
at all (even if ``unittest2`` is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to
remove it in this release.

If you experience a regression because of this, please
`file an issue <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/new>`__.
