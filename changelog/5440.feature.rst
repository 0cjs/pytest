The `faulthandler <https://docs.python.org/3/library/faulthandler.html>`__ standard library
module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.

This functionality was provided by integrating the external
`pytest-faulthandler <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler>`__ plugin into the core,
so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.

For more information see the docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html#fault-handler
