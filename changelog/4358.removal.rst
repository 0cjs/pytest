Remove the ``::()`` notation to denote a test class instance in node ids.

Previously, node ids that contain test instances would use ``::()`` to denote the instance like this::

    test_foo.py::Test::()::test_bar

The extra ``::()`` was puzzling to most users and has been removed, so that the test id becomes now::

    test_foo.py::Test::test_bar

This change could not accompany a deprecation period as is usual when user-facing functionality changes because
it was not really possible to detect when the functionality was being used explicitly.

The extra ``::()`` might have been removed in some places internally already,
which then led to confusion in places where it was expected, e.g. with
``--deselect`` (`#4127 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4127>`_).

Test class instances are also not listed with ``--collect-only`` anymore.
