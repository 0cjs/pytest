A warning is now issued when assertions are made directly against ``None``.

This is a common source of confusion among new users, which write::

    assert mocked_object.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key='value')
    
When they should write::     

    mocked_object.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key='value')

Because the ``assert_called_with`` method of mock objects already executes an assertion.
