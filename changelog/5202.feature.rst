New ``record_testsuite_property`` session-scoped fixture allows users to log ``<property>`` tags at the ``testsuite``
level with the ``junitxml`` plugin.

The generated XML is compatible with the latest xunit standard, contrary to
the properties recorded by ``record_property`` and ``record_xml_attribute``.
