Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example
typing ``pytest --doctest-mod`` inplace of ``--doctest-modules``.
This was previously allowed where the ``ArgumentParser`` thought it was unambiguous,
but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.
See for example issues `#1149 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1149>`__,
`#3413 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3413>`__, and
`#4009 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4009>`__.
