Import ``Mapping`` and ``Sequence`` from ``_pytest.compat`` instead of directly
from ``collections`` in ``python_api.py::approx``. Add ``Mapping`` to
``_pytest.compat``, import it from ``collections`` on python 2, but from
``collections.abc`` on Python 3 to avoid a ``DeprecationWarning`` on
Python 3.7 or newer.
