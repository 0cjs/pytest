The `testpaths <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#confval-testpaths>`__ configuration option is now displayed next
to the ``rootdir`` and ``inifile`` lines in the pytest header if the option is in effect, i.e., directories or file names were
not explicitly passed in the command line.
