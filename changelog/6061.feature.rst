Adding the pluginmanager as an option to :py:func:`~hookspec.pytest_addoption`
so that hooks can be invoked when setting up command line options. This is
useful for having one plugin communicate things to another plugin,
such as default values or which set of command line options to add. See
:ref:`Using hooks in pytest_addoption <addoptionhooks>` for more details.
